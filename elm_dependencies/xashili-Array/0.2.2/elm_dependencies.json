  , "description":
  "This library implements arrays with Relaxed Radix Balanced-Tree (RRB-Tree) 
backends. This makes them functional, but fast. Based on Phil Bagwell and Tiark 
Rompf: [\"RRB-Trees: Efficient Immutable Vectors\"](http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/169879/files/RMTrees.pdf).

To use this library, a JS file needs to be included when compiling. The file 
should be at \"elm_dependencies/xashili-Array/0.2.2/Native/Array.js\" from where 
you run elm-get. For example, to compile Main.elm in $PROJECT use:

<code> elm -m --script=$PROJECT/elm_dependencies/xashili-Array/0.2.2/Native/Array.js Main.elm </code>
